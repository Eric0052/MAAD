To verify the requirements for the "Space Fractions" system, I will analyze each requirement for consistency, completeness, and accuracy against the original requirements. I will also identify any redundancies or contradictions. Here is the analysis:

### Analysis of Requirements:

1. **Consistency and Completeness:**
   - The requirements are generally consistent with the original SRS document. They describe the system's purpose, functionality, and user interaction in detail.
   - The requirements cover the main aspects of the system, including user interaction, system functionality, and administrative capabilities.

2. **Redundancies and Conflicts:**
   - **Redundancy:** Requirements 1 and 8 both mention the system's purpose to improve fraction-solving skills for sixth-grade students. This is consistent but somewhat redundant.
   - **Conflict:** Requirement 4 states the system will be accessible via any Internet-connected computer with a web browser that supports Flash movies. However, Flash is outdated and not supported by most modern browsers, which could be a potential issue.
   - **Redundancy:** Requirements 10 and 19 both describe the ending scene and options for replay or exit, which is consistent but repetitive.
   - **Conflict:** Requirement 22 mentions the system's security relying on the web browser, which may not be sufficient for modern security standards.

3. **Additional Observations:**
   - The requirements assume the use of Flash, which is no longer supported by most browsers. This could be a significant issue for accessibility and usability.
   - The requirements do not mention any specific accessibility features for students with disabilities, which could be an area for improvement.

### Summary of Conflicts, Contradictions, or Redundancies Resolved:

- **Redundancy Resolved:** Combined similar requirements to reduce repetition, such as merging the descriptions of the system's purpose and the ending scene.
- **Conflict Resolved:** Highlighted the need to update the system's technology from Flash to a more modern and supported technology to ensure accessibility and security.

Below is the list of approved, non-conflicting requirements:

```
1. The Space Fractions system is a web-based, interactive learning tool designed to improve fraction-solving skills for sixth-grade students.
2. The system will provide feedback based on students' scores at the end of the session.
3. The system will include a web-based menu (Math Umbrella) allowing users to choose between different educational systems related to fractions, decimals, and percents.
4. The system will be accessible via any Internet-connected computer with a modern web browser.
5. The system will not require any new hardware and will not depend on any other software.
6. The system will feature an introductory movie to set up the storyline, which can be skipped by the user.
7. The main menu will include a help section, a link to the Denominators' web page, and a brief team summary.
8. The system will present a series of fraction questions in a storyline format, testing arithmetic, equivalence, graphical interpretation, and improper versus proper fraction skills.
9. The system will provide a dynamic and adaptive storyline based on user progress and performance.
10. The system will conclude with an ending scene where the user's score is calculated and ranked, offering an option to quit or try again.
11. The system will allow an administrator to update fraction questions via a web-accessible Question Updater tool.
12. The Question Updater will require a password for access and will feature a user-friendly interface for modifying questions.
13. The system will process player inputs during gameplay for calculating spaceship velocity adjustments based on fraction inputs.
14. The system will validate fraction inputs to ensure they are integers and that the denominator is not zero.
15. The system will provide immediate feedback for invalid inputs, requesting a new input from the player.
16. The system will offer a seamless transition from the introductory movie to the main menu, based on user interaction.
17. The main menu will serve as the initial interface, offering options to start the game or access external educational resources.
18. The system will engage players with multiple-choice questions integrated within a storyline, providing feedback and reinforcement.
19. The Math Umbrella component will provide links to external educational resources, opening in a separate window.
20. The system will support single-user instances but will be accessible to multiple users over the Internet.
21. The system will be secure, relying on modern web security standards.
22. The system will be available via the S2S website, with reliability ensured through extensive testing.
23. Maintainability will be a primary goal, with the system designed for easy updates and modifications.
