# Architecture Evaluation Report for Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS)

## 1. Concise Presentation of the Architecture

The CCTNS architecture is designed around a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) model, which facilitates modularity, reusability, and integration. The system is composed of several key components, including User Management, Complaint Management, Investigation Management, Prosecution Management, Search Management, and Audit Management. These components interact through a centralized backend service, ensuring seamless data flow and process automation. The architecture supports multilingual interfaces, offline functionality, and role-based access control, ensuring accessibility, reliability, and security.

## 2. Articulation of the Business Goals

The primary business goals of the CCTNS system are to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of police operations in crime investigation and criminal detection. The system aims to provide value to police personnel, streamline interactions with citizens, and improve overall productivity by automating routine tasks. Additionally, the system seeks to ensure data security, maintain audit trails, and support scalability to accommodate varying operational needs across different police stations.

## 3. Prioritized Quality Attribute Requirements

The quality attribute requirements for the CCTNS system are prioritized as follows:

1. **Security**: Ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and access control.
2. **Usability**: Providing a user-friendly interface with multilingual support.
3. **Performance**: Achieving acceptable response times for searches and data retrieval.
4. **Reliability**: Maintaining system availability and supporting offline functionality.
5. **Scalability**: Supporting varying operational sizes and loads.
6. **Maintainability**: Facilitating easy updates and configuration changes.

## 4. Set of Risks and Non-Risks

### Risks

- **Security Risks**: Potential vulnerabilities in data transmission and storage, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
- **Performance Risks**: Challenges in maintaining response times under peak loads or with large data volumes.
- **Usability Risks**: Complexity in user interface customization and multilingual support.

### Non-Risks

- **Modularity**: The use of SOA ensures modularity and reusability, reducing the risk of integration issues.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale, minimizing risks associated with varying operational sizes.

## 5. Set of Risk Themes

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: The need for robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal standards.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The potential for performance degradation under high load conditions, necessitating efficient resource management.
- **Usability Challenges**: Ensuring the system is intuitive and accessible to a diverse user base, including non-technical users.

## 6. Mapping of Architectural Decisions to Quality Requirements

- **SOA Implementation**: Supports modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Centralized Authentication**: Enhances security and usability through single sign-on.
- **Multilingual Support**: Addresses usability and accessibility requirements.
- **SSL and VPN Connections**: Ensures data security and integrity.
- **Offline Functionality**: Enhances reliability and availability.

## 7. Set of Identified Sensitivity Points and Tradeoff Points

### Sensitivity Points

- **Authentication Mechanism**: Affects both security and usability.
- **Data Encryption**: Impacts security and performance.

### Tradeoff Points

- **Security vs. Performance**: Implementing robust security measures may impact system performance, requiring a balance between the two.
- **Usability vs. Customization**: Providing extensive customization options may complicate the user interface, affecting usability.

In conclusion, the CCTNS architecture is designed to meet the specified business goals and quality attribute requirements. However, attention must be paid to identified risks and tradeoff points to ensure the system's success and alignment with organizational objectives.
