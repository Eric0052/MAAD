### Mismatch Analysis Report

#### [Mismatch 1]
- **Description:** The UML diagrams do not explicitly represent the non-functional requirements such as user-friendliness, performance, and accessibility standards (e.g., ISO 9241 compliance).
- **Impact:** This omission could lead to a lack of focus on critical non-functional aspects during the design and implementation phases, potentially resulting in a system that does not meet user expectations for usability and performance.
- **Recommendation:** Integrate non-functional requirements into the UML diagrams by adding notes or annotations that highlight these aspects. Additionally, consider creating separate diagrams or documentation that specifically address non-functional requirements.

#### [Mismatch 2]
- **Description:** The UML diagrams do not show the audit trail functionality as a separate component or service, despite its critical role in security and compliance.
- **Impact:** Without explicit representation, the audit trail functionality might be underdeveloped or overlooked, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and non-compliance with legal standards.
- **Recommendation:** Update the UML diagrams to include the audit trail as a distinct component or service. Ensure that its interactions with other components are clearly defined, particularly in the sequence and activity diagrams.

#### [Mismatch 3]
- **Description:** The UML diagrams do not reflect the requirement for multilingual support and offline functionality.
- **Impact:** This could result in a system that is not fully accessible to users in different regions or during network outages, limiting its effectiveness and user satisfaction.
- **Recommendation:** Modify the UML diagrams to include multilingual and offline capabilities, possibly as part of the user interface or backend services. Ensure these features are considered in the design and implementation phases.

#### [Mismatch 4]
- **Description:** The security requirements, such as SSL encryption and role-based access control, are not explicitly depicted in the UML diagrams.
- **Impact:** This could lead to inadequate security measures being implemented, exposing the system to potential threats and unauthorized access.
- **Recommendation:** Incorporate security features into the UML diagrams, particularly in the component and deployment diagrams. Highlight the use of SSL, VPN, and role-based access control to ensure these are prioritized during development.

#### [Mismatch 5]
- **Description:** The UML diagrams do not address the requirement for a centralized authentication service and single sign-on functionality.
- **Impact:** This could result in a fragmented authentication process, reducing security and user convenience.
- **Recommendation:** Update the UML diagrams to include a centralized authentication service. Ensure that its interactions with other components are clearly defined, particularly in the sequence and component diagrams.

#### [Mismatch 6]
- **Description:** The UML diagrams do not show the system's ability to handle unplanned downtime and ensure high availability.
- **Impact:** This could lead to a system that is not resilient to failures, affecting its reliability and user trust.
- **Recommendation:** Include high availability and disaster recovery mechanisms in the UML diagrams, particularly in the deployment and component diagrams. Highlight strategies for minimizing downtime and ensuring quick recovery.

By addressing these mismatches, the CCTNS system can better align with the specified requirements, ensuring a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution.
