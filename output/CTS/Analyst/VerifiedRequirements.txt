To verify the requirements for the Crime & Criminals Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), I will perform the following tasks:

1. **Verify Consistency and Contradictions:**
   - Ensure each requirement is consistent with the original requirements.
   - Identify any contradictions or inconsistencies within the requirements.

2. **Detect Redundancies and Conflicts:**
   - Identify any redundant or conflicting entries in the requirements.

3. **Create Output File:**
   - List only the approved, non-conflicting requirements in an output file named "verified_requirements.txt".

4. **Summary of Resolutions:**
   - Provide a summary of any conflicts, contradictions, or redundancies that were resolved.
