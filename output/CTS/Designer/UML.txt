To create the required UML diagrams using PlantUML syntax, we will break down the requirements into logical, process, development, physical, and scenario views. Each view will be represented in PlantUML syntax, and key architectural decisions will be documented.

### 1. Logical View

#### 1.1 Class Diagram
The class diagram represents the static structure of the CCTNS system, showing the system's classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.

```plantuml
@startuml
class User {
    +userID: String
    +name: String
    +role: String
    +login()
    +logout()
}

class PolicePersonnel extends User {
    +registerComplaint()
    +initiateInvestigation()
}

class Citizen extends User {
    +submitComplaint()
    +viewComplaintStatus()
}

class Complaint {
    +complaintID: String
    +description: String
    +status: String
    +register()
    +updateStatus()
}

class Investigation {
    +investigationID: String
    +startDate: Date
    +endDate: Date
    +conductInvestigation()
    +generateReport()
}

class Prosecution {
    +prosecutionID: String
    +courtDate: Date
    +recordCourtInteraction()
}

class Search {
    +searchID: String
    +executeBasicSearch()
    +executeAdvancedSearch()
}

class AuditTrail {
    +logID: String
    +action: String
    +timestamp: Date
    +logAction()
}

User "1" -- "0..*" Complaint
PolicePersonnel "1" -- "0..*" Investigation
Investigation "1" -- "0..*" Prosecution
Prosecution "1" -- "0..*" Search
Search "1" -- "0..*" AuditTrail
@enduml
```

#### 1.2 Object Diagram
The object diagram provides a snapshot of the system at a particular point in time, showing instances of classes and their relationships.

```plantuml
@startuml
object policeOfficer {
    userID = "PO123"
    name = "Officer John"
    role = "PolicePersonnel"
}

object citizen {
    userID = "CIT456"
    name = "Jane Doe"
    role = "Citizen"
}

object complaint {
    complaintID = "CMP789"
    description = "Theft Report"
    status = "Registered"
}

object investigation {
    investigationID = "INV101"
    startDate = "2023-10-01"
    endDate = "2023-10-15"
}

policeOfficer -- complaint
citizen -- complaint
policeOfficer -- investigation
@enduml
```

#### 1.3 State Diagram
The state diagram shows the states of a complaint and the transitions between these states.

```plantuml
@startuml
[*] --> Registered
Registered --> Under_Investigation : "Initiate Investigation"
Under_Investigation --> Prosecution : "Proceed to Prosecution"
Prosecution --> Closed : "Case Closed"
Closed --> [*]
@enduml
```

### 2. Development View

#### 2.1 Package Diagram
The package diagram organizes the system into packages, showing dependencies between them.

```plantuml
@startuml
package "CCTNS System" {
    package "User Management" {
        class User
        class PolicePersonnel
        class Citizen
    }
    package "Complaint Management" {
        class Complaint
    }
    package "Investigation Management" {
        class Investigation
    }
    package "Prosecution Management" {
        class Prosecution
    }
    package "Search Management" {
        class Search
    }
    package "Audit Management" {
        class AuditTrail
    }
}

UserManagement --> ComplaintManagement
ComplaintManagement --> InvestigationManagement
InvestigationManagement --> ProsecutionManagement
ProsecutionManagement --> SearchManagement
SearchManagement --> AuditManagement
@enduml
```

#### 2.2 Component Diagram
The component diagram shows the components of the system and their interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
component "User Interface" {
    [Login Component]
    [Registration Component]
}

component "Backend Services" {
    [Authentication Service]
    [Complaint Service]
    [Investigation Service]
    [Prosecution Service]
    [Search Service]
    [Audit Service]
}

UserInterface --> BackendServices
@enduml
```

### 3. Process View

#### 3.1 Activity Diagram
The activity diagram represents the workflow of registering and processing a complaint.

```plantuml
@startuml
start
:User Login;
if (Authenticated?) then (yes)
    :Register Complaint;
    :Initiate Investigation;
    :Proceed to Prosecution;
    :Close Case;
else (no)
    :Display Error;
endif
stop
@enduml
```

#### 3.2 Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram shows the interaction between users and the system during the complaint registration process.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Backend Services" as BS
participant "Database" as DB

User -> UI: Login
UI -> BS: Authenticate
BS -> DB: Verify Credentials
DB --> BS: Authentication Result
BS --> UI: Authentication Status
UI --> User: Access Granted

User -> UI: Register Complaint
UI -> BS: Submit Complaint
BS -> DB: Store Complaint
DB --> BS: Confirmation
BS --> UI: Registration Confirmation
UI --> User: Complaint Registered
@enduml
```

#### 3.3 Collaboration Diagram
The collaboration diagram shows the interaction between objects in the system during a complaint process.

```plantuml
@startuml
object User
object UI
object BS
object DB

User -> UI: Login
UI -> BS: Authenticate
BS -> DB: Verify Credentials
DB --> BS: Authentication Result
BS --> UI: Authentication Status
UI --> User: Access Granted

User -> UI: Register Complaint
UI -> BS: Submit Complaint
BS -> DB: Store Complaint
DB --> BS: Confirmation
BS --> UI: Registration Confirmation
UI --> User: Complaint Registered
@enduml
```

### 4. Physical View

#### 4.1 Deployment Diagram
The deployment diagram shows the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.

```plantuml
@startuml
node "Data Center" {
    [Application Server] --> [Database Server]
    [Database Server] --> [Security Server]
    [Security Server] --> [Network Server]
    [Network Server] --> [Communication Server]
    [Communication Server] --> [Mobile Server]
}
@enduml
```

#### 4.2 Container Diagram
The container diagram shows the containers (applications, databases, etc.) that make up the system.

```plantuml
@startuml
node "CCTNS System" {
    [Web Application] --> [API Gateway]
    [API Gateway] --> [Backend Services]
    [Backend Services] --> [Database]
    [Database] --> [Audit Trail]
}
@enduml
```

### 5. Scenario View

#### 5.1 Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram shows the interactions between users and the system.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
actor PolicePersonnel
actor Citizen

User -> (Login)
PolicePersonnel -> (Register Complaint)
Citizen -> (Submit Complaint)
(Complaint Process) --> (Investigation Process)
(Investigation Process) --> (Prosecution Process)
(Prosecution Process) --> (Search)
(Search) --> (Audit Trail)
@enduml
```

### 6. Architectural Decisions

**[Decision 1]:** Use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)  
*Rationale:* SOA allows for modularity and reusability, aligning with the requirement for a modular design and ease of integration.

**[Decision 2]:** Implementation of a centralized authentication service  
*Rationale:* Centralized authentication enhances security and usability by providing a single sign-on experience.

**[Decision 3]:** Support for multilingual interfaces  
*Rationale:* Multilingual support ensures usability and accessibility across different regions.

**[Decision 4]:** Use of SSL and secure VPN connections  
*Rationale:* Ensures data confidentiality and integrity, complying with security standards.

**[Decision 5]:** Offline functionality for critical operations  
*Rationale:* Ensures availability and reliability during network outages.

**[Decision 6]:** Implementation of role-based access control  
*Rationale:* Enhances security by ensuring users have access only to necessary functionalities.

These architectural decisions were made to ensure the CCTNS system meets the specified requirements and constraints, providing a robust, secure, and efficient solution.
