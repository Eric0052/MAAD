Based on the provided requirements, the standard architectural views (Logic View, Process View, Development View, Physical View, and Scenario View) generally cover the necessary aspects of the system's architecture. However, given the specific focus on quality attributes such as security, usability, and maintainability, it might be beneficial to consider additional views or augment existing ones to ensure these attributes are thoroughly addressed. Here are some considerations:

1. **Security View**: Given the emphasis on security (ASR-005, FR-005, NFR-003, DC-007), a Security View could be beneficial. This view would detail the security mechanisms, protocols, and policies in place to protect the system and user data.

2. **Usability View**: With a strong focus on usability and accessibility (ASR-001, NFR-001, DC-005), a Usability View could provide insights into the user interface design, user experience considerations, and accessibility features.

3. **Maintainability View**: Considering the importance of maintainability (ASR-007, FR-005, NFR-005, DC-013), a Maintainability View could outline the modular design, documentation practices, and update mechanisms.

Below is an example of how you might represent a **Security View** using PlantUML syntax:

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Security View" {
    component "Web Server" {
        [HTTPS Protocol]
        [Secure Authentication]
        [Data Encryption]
    }
    
    component "Authentication System" {
        [User Login]
        [Password Management]
    }
    
    component "Security Module" {
        [Firewall]
        [Intrusion Detection]
    }
    
    [User] --> [Web Server] : Access via HTTPS
    [Web Server] --> [Authentication System] : Authenticate User
    [Web Server] --> [Security Module] : Monitor and Protect
}

This Security View highlights the components and interactions related to securing the system. Similar views can be created for Usability and Maintainability, focusing on their respective aspects. These additional views help ensure that the system's architecture comprehensively addresses all critical quality attributes and requirements.
