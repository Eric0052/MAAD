The architecture is designed to be maintainable, reliable, and adaptable to future educational needs.

## 2. Articulation of the Business Goals

The primary business goals of the Space Fractions system are:
- To provide an engaging and effective educational tool for sixth-grade students to improve their fraction-solving skills.
- To offer a customizable and maintainable platform for educators to update and manage educational content.
- To ensure accessibility and ease of use for students and teachers with basic computer skills.
- To integrate additional educational resources to enhance the learning experience.

## 3. Prioritized Quality Attribute Requirements Expressed as Quality Attribute Scenarios

1. **Usability**: The system must be intuitive for sixth-grade students, allowing them to navigate and interact with the game without frustration. Scenario: A student can start the game, answer questions, and receive feedback without external assistance.

2. **Maintainability**: The system should allow educators to easily update and modify questions. Scenario: An administrator can log in, update questions, and see changes reflected in the game without technical support.

3. **Performance**: The system should provide immediate feedback and maintain responsive gameplay. Scenario: A student receives feedback on their answer within one second of submission.

4. **Reliability**: The system should function correctly under normal usage conditions. Scenario: The game runs without errors or crashes during a typical session.

5. **Security**: The system should protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Scenario: Only authorized administrators can update questions after successful authentication.

## 4. A Set of Risks and Non-Risks

### Risks
- **Dependency on Flash**: The requirement for a Flash-supporting browser poses a risk due to the declining support for Flash technology.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: The system's reliance on web-based access could expose it to security threats if not properly managed.
- **Performance Issues**: The need for immediate feedback may be compromised if the server or network experiences high load.

### Non-Risks
- **User Interface Simplicity**: The use of mouse clicks for interaction is a non-risk as it aligns with the target users' capabilities.
- **Content Update Process**: The administrative interface for updating questions is straightforward and does not pose a risk to maintainability.

## 5. A Set of Risk Themes

- **Technology Obsolescence**: The reliance on Flash technology is a systemic risk that could affect the system's longevity and accessibility.
- **Security Concerns**: The need for secure data handling and access control is a recurring theme that must be addressed to protect user information.
- **Performance Scalability**: Ensuring the system can handle multiple simultaneous users without degradation in performance is a critical concern.

## 6. Mapping of Architectural Decisions to Quality Requirements

- **Use of Web-Based Platform**: Supports accessibility and usability but poses risks to security and performance.
- **Flash Dependency**: Initially supports rich media interaction but hinders long-term maintainability and accessibility.
- **Modular Design**: Enhances maintainability and adaptability, allowing for easy updates and content management.

## 7. A Set of Identified Sensitivity Points and Tradeoff Points

### Sensitivity Points
- **Feedback Timing**: The architecture's ability to provide immediate feedback is sensitive to server performance and network latency.
- **Security Measures**: The effectiveness of security protocols is sensitive to the architecture's design and implementation of access controls.

### Tradeoff Points
- **Performance vs. Security**: Enhancing security measures may introduce additional processing overhead, potentially affecting performance.
- **Usability vs. Maintainability**: Simplifying the user interface for students may limit the flexibility of content updates for administrators.

This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Space Fractions system architecture, identifying key strengths and areas for improvement to ensure alignment with business goals and quality attribute requirements.
