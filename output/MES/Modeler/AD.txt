# Architectural Documentation for the APAF System

## 1. Overall Architecture Design Ideas

The APAF system architecture is designed to efficiently acquire, process, store, and distribute telemetry and science data from the ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express. The architecture is modular, allowing for scalability and integration with existing infrastructure at SwRI. It emphasizes a robust data processing pipeline, secure web-based interfaces, and compliance with NASA standards. The architecture is divided into several key components, including data acquisition, processing, storage, distribution, and user access, each designed to meet specific functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Goals

- **Timely Data Processing and Distribution**: Ensure that telemetry and science data are processed and made available to Co-Investigators within 24 hours of acquisition.
- **Data Integrity and Reliability**: Maintain high data integrity through robust error handling and validation mechanisms.
- **Security and Compliance**: Implement security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with NASA's data repository standards.
- **Usability and Accessibility**: Provide user-friendly web-based interfaces for data access and analysis, with appropriate access controls.
- **Maintainability and Scalability**: Design a system that is easy to maintain and can scale to accommodate future data processing needs.

## 3. Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Design the system in modular components to facilitate maintenance, scalability, and integration with external systems.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize data processing and storage to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Security by Design**: Incorporate security measures at every layer of the architecture to protect data and ensure privacy.
- **Compliance Focus**: Ensure all data handling processes align with NASA's standards and guidelines.
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize usability in the design of web-based interfaces to enhance user experience.

## 4. Key Technologies

- **Data Acquisition and Processing**: Utilize high-performance data acquisition tools and processing engines capable of handling large datasets.
- **Storage Solutions**: Implement scalable storage systems, such as distributed databases or cloud storage, to ensure data availability and re-processing capabilities.
- **Web Technologies**: Use modern web frameworks and technologies to develop secure and responsive web-based interfaces.
- **Security Tools**: Deploy authentication and authorization tools to manage user access and protect sensitive data.
- **Compliance Tools**: Integrate data validation and calibration tools to ensure compliance with NASA's PDS standards.

## 5. Constraints

- **System Architecture**: Must align with SwRI's existing infrastructure and technology stack.
- **Data Processing**: Must efficiently process data into IDFS and handle necessary calibration and validation.
- **Storage and Archiving**: Must include a local archive for data availability and re-processing.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Must provide secure and user-friendly access to data.
- **Error Handling**: Must include robust error detection and recovery mechanisms.
- **Data Distribution**: Must ensure timely and compliant data distribution to Co-Investigators.
- **Security and Privacy**: Must implement strong security measures to protect data.
- **Compliance with NASA Standards**: Must adhere to NASA's data repository requirements.
- **Operational Procedures**: Must include detailed operational procedures to eliminate the need for additional training.

### Potential Risks

- **Data Volume and Performance**: The system must handle large volumes of data without performance degradation.
- **Security Threats**: The system must be resilient against potential security breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Compliance Challenges**: Ensuring continuous compliance with evolving NASA standards may require ongoing adjustments to the system.
