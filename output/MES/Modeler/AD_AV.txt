Based on the provided requirements, the standard architectural views (Logic View, Process View, Development View, Physical View, and Scenario View) cover most of the necessary aspects of the system architecture. However, given the specific requirements and constraints, it might be beneficial to consider an additional view focused on **Security and Compliance**. This view would address the security measures, compliance with NASA standards, and data privacy requirements, which are critical for the APAF system.

### Security and Compliance View

This view will focus on the security architecture, compliance mechanisms, and data privacy measures. It will illustrate how the system ensures data protection, user authentication, and compliance with NASA standards.

#### PlantUML Syntax for Security and Compliance View

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Security and Compliance View" {
    component "Web Server" {
        [Authentication Service] --> [User Database]
        [Authorization Module] --> [Access Control List]
    }
    
    component "Data Processing Module" {
        [Data Validation Service] --> [Compliance Verification System]
        [Data Calibration Module] --> [NASA PDS Interface]
    }
    
    component "Data Storage" {
        [Encrypted Storage] --> [Data Archive]
    }
    
    component "Network Security" {
        [Firewall] --> [Intrusion Detection System]
    }
    
    [User] --> [Authentication Service] : "Login"
    [Authentication Service] --> [Authorization Module] : "Verify Access"
    [Authorization Module] --> [Web Server] : "Grant Access"
    
    [Data Processing Module] --> [Data Validation Service] : "Validate Data"
    [Data Validation Service] --> [Compliance Verification System] : "Check Compliance"
    
    [Data Processing Module] --> [Data Calibration Module] : "Calibrate Data"
    [Data Calibration Module] --> [NASA PDS Interface] : "Submit Data"
    
    [Data Storage] --> [Encrypted Storage] : "Store Data"
    [Network Security] --> [Firewall] : "Monitor Traffic"
    [Network Security] --> [Intrusion Detection System] : "Detect Threats"
}

### Explanation

- **Authentication Service**: Ensures that only authorized users can access the system, using a user database for credentials.
- **Authorization Module**: Manages user permissions and access control, ensuring that users can only access data they are permitted to.
- **Data Validation Service**: Validates data against compliance requirements, ensuring that all data meets NASA standards.
- **Data Calibration Module**: Calibrates data before submission to NASA PDS, ensuring accuracy and compliance.
- **Encrypted Storage**: Protects data at rest, ensuring that sensitive information is encrypted and secure.
- **Network Security**: Includes a firewall and intrusion detection system to protect against unauthorized access and threats.

This additional view provides a focused perspective on how the system addresses security and compliance, which are critical for the APAF system's operation and adherence to NASA standards.
