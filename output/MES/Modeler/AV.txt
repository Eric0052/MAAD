To address the provided requirements and constraints, I will generate the architectural views using PlantUML syntax. Each view will be structured to reflect the specific aspects of the system architecture as described in the requirements.

### 1. [Logic View]

The logic view illustrates the primary functional modules of the system and their interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
package "APAF System" {
    [Data Acquisition Module] --> [Processing Engine]
    [Processing Engine] --> [Data Processing Module]
    [Data Processing Module] --> [Storage System]
    [Storage System] --> [Web Server]
    [Web Server] --> [Authentication Service]
    [Error Handling Module] --> [Logging System]
    [Data Distribution Network] --> [Co-Investigator Access Portal]
    [Software Integration Layer] --> [NASA Data Repository Interface]
    [Data Calibration Module] --> [Compliance Verification System]
}
@enduml
```

### 2. [Process View]

The process view focuses on the dynamic aspects of the system, including concurrency and distribution.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ESOC
actor "ASPERA-3 Team" as Team
actor "Co-Investigators" as CoI
actor "NASA PDS" as PDS

ESOC -> [Data Acquisition Module] : Acquire Telemetry Data
[Data Acquisition Module] -> [Processing Engine] : Process Data Daily
[Processing Engine] -> [Data Processing Module] : Process Science Data
[Data Processing Module] -> [Storage System] : Store Data
[Storage System] -> [Web Server] : Provide Web-Based Displays
Team -> [Web Server] : Access Science Analysis Displays
CoI -> [Co-Investigator Access Portal] : Access Data
[Data Processing Module] -> [Data Distribution Network] : Distribute Data
[Data Processing Module] -> [Data Calibration Module] : Calibrate Data
[Data Calibration Module] -> PDS : Provide PDS-Compliant Data
@enduml
```

### 3. [Development View]

The development view illustrates the system from a programmer's perspective.

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Development View" {
    component "Data Acquisition Module" {
        [Telemetry Acquisition]
        [Data Preprocessing]
    }
    component "Processing Engine" {
        [Data Transformation]
        [Data Validation]
    }
    component "Data Processing Module" {
        [IDFS Generation]
        [Data Analysis]
    }
    component "Storage System" {
        [Local Archive]
        [Data Backup]
    }
    component "Web Server" {
        [Public Display]
        [Restricted Access]
    }
    component "Authentication Service" {
        [User Authentication]
        [Access Control]
    }
    component "Error Handling Module" {
        [Error Detection]
        [Error Recovery]
    }
    component "Data Distribution Network" {
        [Data Delivery]
        [Network Management]
    }
    component "Software Integration Layer" {
        [Repository Integration]
        [API Management]
    }
    component "Data Calibration Module" {
        [Calibration Algorithms]
        [Validation Checks]
    }
    component "Compliance Verification System" {
        [Compliance Checks]
        [Reporting]
    }
}

### 4. [Physical View]

The physical view depicts the system from a system engineer's perspective.

```plantuml
@startuml
node "SwRI Data Center" {
    [Data Acquisition Module]
    [Processing Engine]
    [Data Processing Module]
    [Storage System]
    [Web Server]
    [Authentication Service]
    [Error Handling Module]
    [Data Distribution Network]
    [Software Integration Layer]
    [Data Calibration Module]
    [Compliance Verification System]
}
@enduml
```

### 5. [Scenario View]

The scenario view illustrates a use case scenario.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor ESOC
actor "ASPERA-3 Team" as Team
actor "Co-Investigators" as CoI

ESOC -> [Data Acquisition Module] : Acquire Telemetry Data
[Data Acquisition Module] -> [Processing Engine] : Process Data
[Processing Engine] -> [Data Processing Module] : Generate IDFS
[Data Processing Module] -> [Storage System] : Store Data
[Storage System] -> [Web Server] : Display Data
Team -> [Web Server] : Access Science Analysis
CoI -> [Co-Investigator Access Portal] : Retrieve Data

### 6. [Architectural Decisions]

- **[Decision 1]:** Use a modular architecture to facilitate integration with external systems and repositories. This decision supports interoperability and maintainability, aligning with ASR-006 and DC-001.
  
- **[Decision 2]:** Implement a robust data acquisition and processing pipeline to ensure performance and reliability, as required by ASR-001 and DC-002. This decision ensures timely and reliable data handling.

- **[Decision 3]:** Incorporate secure web application architecture with user authentication to protect sensitive data, as specified in ASR-003 and DC-007. This decision addresses security and privacy concerns.

- **[Decision 4]:** Design the system to comply with NASA's data repository standards, ensuring data is calibrated and validated, as required by ASR-007 and DC-009. This decision ensures compliance and data integrity.

- **[Decision 5]:** Include built-in error handling mechanisms to maintain data integrity, as specified in ASR-004 and DC-005. This decision enhances reliability and maintainability.

These architectural decisions were made to ensure the system meets the specified requirements while adhering to operational, security, and compliance standards.
