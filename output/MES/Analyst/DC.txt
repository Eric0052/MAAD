The Design Constraints are:

1. **DC-001: System Architecture**  
   The APAF system must be designed to support the acquisition, processing, and storage of telemetry and science data in a manner that aligns with the existing infrastructure and technology stack at SwRI.

2. **DC-002: Data Processing**  
   The system must be capable of processing data into Instrument Data File Sets (IDFS) and handling engineering and ancillary information necessary for calibration and science validation.

3. **DC-003: Storage and Archiving**  
   The system must include a local SwRI archive for storing telemetry and IDFS data, ensuring data availability and re-processing capabilities.

4. **DC-004: Web-Based Interface**  
   The design must incorporate web-based displays for public and restricted access, with appropriate password protection mechanisms.

5. **DC-005: Error Handling**  
   The system must include built-in error handling features to maintain data integrity throughout the processing and storage phases.

6. **DC-006: Data Distribution**  
   The design must facilitate the timely distribution of data to Co-Investigators and ensure compliance with NASA PDS standards for data provision.

7. **DC-007: Security and Privacy**  
   The system must implement security measures, including password protection, to safeguard sensitive data and restrict access to authorized personnel only.

8. **DC-008: Maintenance and Support**  
   The design must allow for ongoing system maintenance and software support to ensure operational continuity.

9. **DC-009: Compliance with NASA Standards**  
   The system must comply with NASA's data repository requirements, ensuring that all data is calibrated, validated, and deposited in a PDS-compliant form.

10. **DC-010: Operational Procedures**  
    The design must include clear operational procedures documented in the APAF Operation Procedures Document, eliminating the need for additional training requirements.

These constraints ensure that the system is designed to meet the specified requirements while adhering to operational, security, and compliance standards.
