To verify the requirements for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) Ground Data System, I will perform the following tasks:

1. **Verify Consistency and Freedom from Contradictions:**
   - Each requirement will be checked to ensure it aligns with the overall goals and objectives of the APAF system as described in the original requirements.
   - Ensure that no requirement contradicts another.

2. **Detect Redundancies or Conflicts:**
   - Identify any requirements that are repeated or overlap significantly.
   - Highlight any requirements that may conflict with others.

3. **Create an Output File:**
   - List only the approved, non-conflicting requirements in a file named "verified_requirements.txt".

4. **Summary of Resolved Issues:**
   - Provide a summary of any conflicts, contradictions, or redundancies that were identified and resolved.

### Verification Process:

#### Consistency and Contradictions:

- **FR-001 to FR-007**: These requirements are consistent with the need to acquire, process, and store telemetry and science data. No contradictions found.
- **FR-008 and FR-009**: Both requirements address web-based displays, with FR-009 specifying password protection for certain data. They are consistent with the need for public and restricted access.
- **FR-010**: Error handling is a necessary feature for data integrity, consistent with the system's objectives.
- **FR-011 to FR-013**: These requirements ensure data and software are available to Co-Investigators, aligning with the system's collaborative goals.
- **PR-001**: Privacy requirements are consistent with the need to protect sensitive data.
- **CR-001**: System maintenance and support are essential for operational continuity.
- **DR-001 to DR-009**: Delivery requirements are consistent with the need for timely and compliant data distribution.
- **NR-001 to NR-003**: Non-requirements are consistent with the system's operational scope and safety considerations.

#### Redundancies and Conflicts:

- **FR-011 and DR-001 to DR-003**: These requirements overlap in specifying data distribution to Co-Investigators. They can be consolidated to avoid redundancy.
- **FR-012 and DR-007**: Both mention providing IDFS data processing algorithms, which can be combined for clarity.
- **FR-013 and DR-008**: Both address the availability of science analysis software, which can be consolidated.
- **DR-004 to DR-006**: These requirements regarding data provision to NASA PDS are consistent but can be streamlined for clarity.
- **DR-009**: This requirement is consistent with the need for clear distribution mechanisms.

### Summary of Resolved Issues:

- **Redundancy**: Requirements related to data distribution and software availability were consolidated to avoid repetition.
- **Clarity**: Streamlined requirements related to NASA PDS data provision for better clarity.

### Output File: "verified_requirements.txt"

Below is the content of the "verified_requirements.txt" file, listing the approved, non-conflicting requirements:

```
1. The APAF system shall acquire telemetry data of the ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express Orbit/Attitude from ESOC and automatically process the data on a daily basis. (FR-001)
2. The APAF system shall process all ASPERA-3 science data into Instrument Data File Sets (IDFS). (FR-002)
3. The APAF system shall process engineering and ancillary information necessary for calibration and science validation into IDFS data sets. (FR-003)
4. Intermediate files of cleaned-up ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry shall be generated if cleaned-up telemetry is not provided by ESOC. (FR-004)
5. The ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry data shall be stored on a local SwRI archive for data availability and re-processing. (FR-005)
6. The ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data sets shall be stored on a local SwRI archive for data availability and analysis. (FR-006)
7. Any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry shall be stored on a local SwRI archive for data availability and re-processing. (FR-007)
8. Web-based displays of the most current ASPERA-3 data shall be provided for public view to monitor instrument performance. (FR-008)
9. Web-based displays defined by the ASPERA-3 team shall be provided for science analysis and shall be password protected until the data is made public. (FR-009)
10. The APAF ground data system shall have built-in error handling for better data integrity. (FR-010)
11. ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data and any APAF-generated intermediate files of cleaned-up telemetry shall be provided to all ASPERA-3 Co-Investigators (Co-I's) within 24 hours of acquiring telemetry, given error-free transmission and processing. (FR-011, DR-001, DR-002, DR-003)
12. IDFS data access software and science analysis software developed by SwRI shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I's and integrated into the NASA-approved data repository. (FR-012, FR-013, DR-007, DR-008)
13. The APAF system web server shall be password protected where appropriate to allow only pertinent ASPERA-3 team members access. (PR-001)
14. SwRI shall provide system maintenance and software support for the APAF system. (CR-001)
15. ASPERA-3 IDFS data and MEX OA IDFS data shall be provided to NASA PDS in PDS-compliant form, calibrated and validated prior to depositing, and no later than 6 months after acquisition. (DR-004, DR-005, DR-006)
16. The distribution mechanisms for data sets shall be clearly defined in the APAF Operation Procedures Document. (DR-009)
17. The APAF data system is not required to operate in more than one state or mode. (NR-001)
18. The APAF data system will not impose hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. (NR-002)
19. The APAF Operations Procedures Document shall provide installation and operations procedures in enough detail to eliminate the need for training-related requirements. (NR-003)
