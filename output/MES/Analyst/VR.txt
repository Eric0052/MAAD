1. The APAF system shall acquire telemetry data of the ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express Orbit/Attitude from ESOC and automatically process the data on a daily basis. (FR-001)
2. The APAF system shall process all ASPERA-3 science data into Instrument Data File Sets (IDFS). (FR-002)
3. The APAF system shall process engineering and ancillary information necessary for calibration and science validation into IDFS data sets. (FR-003)
4. Intermediate files of cleaned-up ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry shall be generated if cleaned-up telemetry is not provided by ESOC. (FR-004)
5. The ASPERA-3 and MEX OA telemetry data shall be stored on a local SwRI archive for data availability and re-processing. (FR-005)
6. The ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data sets shall be stored on a local SwRI archive for data availability and analysis. (FR-006)
7. Any APAF-generated intermediate files of ASPERA-3 and MEX OA cleaned-up telemetry shall be stored on a local SwRI archive for data availability and re-processing. (FR-007)
8. Web-based displays of the most current ASPERA-3 data shall be provided for public view to monitor instrument performance. (FR-008)
9. Web-based displays defined by the ASPERA-3 team shall be provided for science analysis and shall be password protected until the data is made public. (FR-009)
10. The APAF ground data system shall have built-in error handling for better data integrity. (FR-010)
11. ASPERA-3 and MEX OA IDFS data and any APAF-generated intermediate files of cleaned-up telemetry shall be provided to all ASPERA-3 Co-Investigators (Co-I's) within 24 hours of acquiring telemetry, given error-free transmission and processing. (FR-011, DR-001, DR-002, DR-003)
12. IDFS data access software and science analysis software developed by SwRI shall be made available to the ASPERA-3 Co-I's and integrated into the NASA-approved data repository. (FR-012, FR-013, DR-007, DR-008)
13. The APAF system web server shall be password protected where appropriate to allow only pertinent ASPERA-3 team members access. (PR-001)
14. SwRI shall provide system maintenance and software support for the APAF system. (CR-001)
15. ASPERA-3 IDFS data and MEX OA IDFS data shall be provided to NASA PDS in PDS-compliant form, calibrated and validated prior to depositing, and no later than 6 months after acquisition. (DR-004, DR-005, DR-006)
16. The distribution mechanisms for data sets shall be clearly defined in the APAF Operation Procedures Document. (DR-009)
17. The APAF data system is not required to operate in more than one state or mode. (NR-001)
18. The APAF data system will not impose hazards to personnel, property, or the environment. (NR-002)
19. The APAF Operations Procedures Document shall provide installation and operations procedures in enough detail to eliminate the need for training-related requirements. (NR-003)
