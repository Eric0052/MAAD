# Architecture Evaluation Report for ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF)

## 1. Concise Presentation of the Architecture

The architecture of the ASPERA-3 Processing and Archiving Facility (APAF) is designed to support the Mars Express mission by processing and archiving data from the ASPERA-3 instrument package. The system is structured into several modules, each responsible for specific functionalities such as data acquisition, processing, storage, distribution, and compliance verification. The architecture is represented through various UML diagrams, including class, object, state, package, component, activity, sequence, collaboration, deployment, container, and use case diagrams. These diagrams collectively illustrate the static and dynamic aspects of the system, its components, interactions, and deployment.

## 2. Articulation of the Business Goals

The primary business goals of the APAF system are to:

- Ensure timely and accurate processing of telemetry data from the ASPERA-3 instruments.
- Provide data products in a form suitable for scientific analysis and archiving.
- Facilitate data distribution to the ASPERA-3 team and Co-Investigators (Co-I's) within specified timeframes.
- Ensure data compliance with NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) standards.
- Support the scientific community by providing access to validated and calibrated data.
- Maintain system reliability, availability, and security to support mission objectives.

## 3. Prioritized Quality Attribute Requirements

The quality attribute requirements for the APAF system are prioritized as follows:

1. **Performance**: The system must process and distribute data within 24 hours of acquisition.
2. **Reliability**: The system must have built-in error handling to ensure data integrity.
3. **Security**: Access to sensitive data must be password-protected.
4. **Usability**: Web-based displays must be user-friendly for public and team access.
5. **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to maintain and update by the SwRI software team.
6. **Compliance**: Data must be PDS-compliant and validated before submission.

## 4. Set of Risks and Non-Risks

### Risks

- **Data Processing Delays**: Potential delays in processing data within the 24-hour window due to system bottlenecks.
- **Security Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data if authentication mechanisms are compromised.
- **Data Integrity**: Risk of data corruption if error handling is not robust.

### Non-Risks

- **Data Storage**: The system's design ensures adequate storage capacity for telemetry and IDFS data.
- **Web-Based Displays**: The architecture supports user-friendly web interfaces for data access.

## 5. Set of Risk Themes

- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The system may face performance issues if data processing and distribution are not optimized.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Inadequate security measures could lead to data breaches.
- **Compliance Challenges**: Ensuring all data meets PDS standards may require additional validation efforts.

## 6. Mapping of Architectural Decisions to Quality Requirements

- **Data Processing Module**: Supports performance by enabling efficient data processing and IDFS generation.
- **Authentication Service**: Addresses security by providing user authentication and access control.
- **Error Handling Module**: Enhances reliability by detecting and recovering from errors.
- **Web Server**: Improves usability by providing web-based displays for data access.

## 7. Set of Identified Sensitivity Points and Tradeoff Points

### Sensitivity Points

- **Data Processing Efficiency**: The efficiency of the data processing module significantly impacts performance.
- **Security Protocols**: The robustness of authentication mechanisms affects system security.

### Tradeoff Points

- **Performance vs. Security**: Enhancing security measures may introduce additional processing overhead, affecting performance.
- **Usability vs. Security**: Implementing strict security protocols may reduce the usability of web-based displays.

This architecture evaluation report provides a comprehensive analysis of the APAF system, highlighting its strengths, potential risks, and areas for improvement. By addressing the identified risks and optimizing the architecture, the system can effectively support the Mars Express mission's data processing and archiving needs.
