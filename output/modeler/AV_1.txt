To address the provided requirements and constraints, I will generate the architectural views using PlantUML syntax. Each view will be structured to reflect the system's architecture, focusing on different aspects as specified.

### 1. [Logic View]

The logic view illustrates the primary functional modules of the system and their interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
package "User Interface" {
  [Main Menu]
  [Game Interface]
  [Admin Interface]
}

package "Backend Services" {
  [Web Server]
  [Data Processing Engine]
  [Feedback Module]
  [Storyline Engine]
  [Content Management System]
  [Input Validation Module]
  [Security Module]
  [Authentication System]
}

[Main Menu] --> [Game Interface]
[Game Interface] --> [Feedback Module]
[Game Interface] --> [Storyline Engine]
[Admin Interface] --> [Content Management System]
[Game Interface] --> [Input Validation Module]
[Web Server] --> [Security Module]
[Web Server] --> [Authentication System]
@enduml
```

### 2. [Process View]

The process view focuses on the dynamic aspects of the system, including runtime behavior and communication.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
actor Admin

User -> [Web Server] : Access System
[Web Server] -> [Game Interface] : Load Game
[Game Interface] -> [Input Validation Module] : Validate Input
[Input Validation Module] -> [Game Interface] : Return Valid/Invalid
[Game Interface] -> [Feedback Module] : Send Score
[Feedback Module] -> User : Provide Feedback

Admin -> [Web Server] : Access Admin Interface
[Web Server] -> [Content Management System] : Update Questions
[Content Management System] -> Admin : Confirm Update
@enduml
```

### 3. [Development View]

The development view illustrates the system from a programmer's perspective.

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Frontend" {
  [HTML/CSS/JS]
  [React Components]
}

package "Backend" {
  [Node.js Server]
  [Express Framework]
  [Database]
}

[HTML/CSS/JS] --> [React Components]
[React Components] --> [Node.js Server]
[Node.js Server] --> [Express Framework]
[Express Framework] --> [Database]
@enduml
```

### 4. [Physical View]

The physical view depicts the system's topology on the physical layer.

```plantuml
@startuml
node "User's Computer" {
  [Web Browser]
}

node "Server" {
  [Web Server]
  [Database]
}

[Web Browser] --> [Web Server] : HTTP/HTTPS
[Web Server] --> [Database] : SQL Queries
@enduml
```

### 5. [Scenario View]

The scenario view uses a use case to illustrate interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
actor Admin

User -> [Main Menu] : Start Game
[Main Menu] -> [Game Interface] : Load Game
[Game Interface] -> [Input Validation Module] : Validate Input
[Input Validation Module] -> [Game Interface] : Return Valid/Invalid
[Game Interface] -> [Feedback Module] : Send Score
[Feedback Module] -> User : Provide Feedback

Admin -> [Admin Interface] : Update Questions
[Admin Interface] -> [Content Management System] : Modify Content
[Content Management System] -> Admin : Confirm Update
@enduml
```

### 6. [Architectural Decisions]

- **[Decision 1]:** Use a web-based platform to ensure accessibility from any Internet-connected computer. This decision aligns with the requirement for broad accessibility and compatibility with modern web browsers.
  
- **[Decision 2]:** Implement a modular architecture to support maintainability and modifiability. This allows for easy updates and modifications without affecting system stability, addressing the maintainability requirement.

- **[Decision 3]:** Incorporate modern web security standards, such as HTTPS and secure authentication, to protect user data and ensure system integrity. This decision is driven by the security requirements.

- **[Decision 4]:** Use a dynamic and adaptive storyline engine to enhance user experience by adjusting content based on user progress. This supports the adaptability and user experience quality attributes.

- **[Decision 5]:** Implement input validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and reliability, preventing errors during gameplay. This decision addresses the reliability and data integrity requirements.

These architectural decisions were made to ensure the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements while adhering to design constraints.
