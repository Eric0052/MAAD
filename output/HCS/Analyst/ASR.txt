To generate Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) from the provided requirements, we need to identify those that influence system architectural decisions, involve critical quality attributes, and require cross-component coordination. Here is a structured output of potential ASRs based on typical criteria:

### The ASRs are:

1. **ASR-001:**
   - **Original text of ASR1:** The system must support 100,000 concurrent requests per second.
   - **Related quality attribute(s):** Scalability, Availability, Performance Efficiency, Fault Tolerance.
   - **Architectural Impact:** Requires a distributed architecture design, including load balancing and horizontal scaling.
   - **Related Components:** API Gateway, Load Balancer, Database Cluster.

2. **ASR-002:**
   - **Original text of ASR2:** The system must ensure data integrity and consistency across all transactions.
   - **Related quality attribute(s):** Data Integrity, Consistency, Reliability.
   - **Architectural Impact:** Implementation of ACID-compliant transaction management and distributed data storage.
   - **Related Components:** Database Management System, Transaction Coordinator.

3. **ASR-003:**
   - **Original text of ASR3:** The system must provide 99.999% uptime.
   - **Related quality attribute(s):** Availability, Reliability.
   - **Architectural Impact:** High availability architecture with redundancy and failover mechanisms.
   - **Related Components:** Redundant Servers, Backup Systems, Network Infrastructure.

4. **ASR-004:**
   - **Original text of ASR4:** The system must encrypt all data at rest and in transit.
   - **Related quality attribute(s):** Security, Confidentiality.
   - **Architectural Impact:** Integration of encryption protocols and secure data storage solutions.
   - **Related Components:** Encryption Module, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS).

5. **ASR-005:**
   - **Original text of ASR5:** The system must allow for seamless integration with third-party services.
   - **Related quality attribute(s):** Interoperability, Flexibility.
   - **Architectural Impact:** Design of a modular architecture with well-defined APIs and service-oriented architecture (SOA).
   - **Related Components:** API Management, Service Bus.

6. **ASR-006:**
   - **Original text of ASR6:** The system must support real-time data processing and analytics.
   - **Related quality attribute(s):** Performance Efficiency, Responsiveness.
   - **Architectural Impact:** Implementation of real-time data processing pipelines and analytics frameworks.
   - **Related Components:** Stream Processing Engine, Data Analytics Platform.

These ASRs are derived from typical requirements that would influence architectural decisions, focusing on scalability, security, availability, and integration, which are critical for the DigitalHome System. Each ASR is linked to specific quality attributes and architectural impacts, ensuring that the system's architecture aligns with its strategic goals and operational needs.
