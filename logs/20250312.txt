humidistats shall be placed in rooms throughout the home.\nA single humidistat shall be placed in an enclosed space (e.g., a room in the house) for which the humidity is to be controlled.\nIf a humdistat device allows a user to make a manual temperature setting, the setting shall remain in effect until the end of the planned or default time period, at which time the planned or default setting will be used for the next time period.\nFor each humidistat, up to twenty-four one hour settings per day for every day of the week can be scheduled.\nA DigitalHome system shall use wireless signals to communicate, through the master control unit, with the humidistats.\nThe DigitalHome security system consists of contact sensors and a set security alarms.\nA DigitalHome system shall be able to manage up to fifty door and window contact sensors.\nA DigitalHome system shall be able to activate both light and sound alarms: one sound alarm and one light alarm subsystem, with multiple lights.\nWhen a security breach occurs and a contact sensor is set OPEN, the alarm system shall be activated.\nThe DigitalHome programmable Appliance Manager shall provide for management of a home’s small appliances, including lighting units, by allowing a user to turn them on or off as desired.\nThe Appliance Manager shall be able to manage up to one hundred 115 volt, 10 amp power switches.\nThe system shall be able to provide information about the state of a power switch (OFF or ON), indicating the whether an appliance connected to the power switch is OFF or ON.\nThe system shall be able to change the state of a power switch (OFF to ON, or ON to OFF), in turn changing the state of an appliance connected to the power switch.\nIf a user changes the state of power switch device manually, the device shall remain in that state until the end of the planned or default time period, at which time the planned or default setting will be used for the next time period.\nDigitalHome Planner shall provide a user with the capability to direct the system to set various preset home parameters (temperature, humidity, security contacts, and on/off appliance/light status) for certain time periods.\nFor a given month and year, a user shall be able to create or modify a month plan that specifies for each day, for up to four daily time periods, the environmental parameter settings (temperature, humidity, contact sensors and power switches).\nA user shall be able to override planned parameter values, through the DigitalHome website, or if available, through manual switches on household devices For a given month and year, in the past two years, DigitalHome shall be able to provide a report on the management and control of the home.\nThe month report shall contain daily average, maximum (with time) and minimum (with time) values of temperature and humidity for each thermostat and humidistat, respectively.\nThe month report shall provide the day and time for which any security breaches occurred, that is, when the security alarms were activated.\nThe month report shall provide a section that indicates the periods of time when the DigitalHome System was not in operation.\nDisplays of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, contact sensors and power switches) shall be updated at least every two seconds.\nSensor (temperature, humidity, contact sensor, power state) shall have a minimum data acquisition rate of 10 Hz.\nAn environmental sensor or controller device shall have to be within 1000 feet of the master control device, in order to be in communication with the system.\nThe DigitalHome System must be highly reliable with no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation.\nThe Digital Home System shall incorporate backup and recovery mechanisms.\nThe DigitalHome System will backup all system data (configuration, default parameter settings, planning, and usage data) on a daily basis, with the backup time set by the DigitalHome Technician at system set up.\nIf the DigitalHome System fails (due to power loss, loss of internet access, or other software or hardware failure), the system recovery mechanism shall restore system data (configuration, default parameter settings, planning, and usage data) from the most recent backup.\nAll DigitalHome operations shall incorporate exception handling so that the system responds to a user with a clear, descriptive message when an error or an exceptional condition occurs.\nAlthough there are no specific safety requirements, high system reliability is important to insure there are no system failures in carrying out user requests.\nSuch failures might affect the safety of home dwellers (e.g., security breaches, inadequate lighting in dark spaces, inappropriate temperature and humidity for people who are in ill-health, or powering certain appliances when young children are present).\nUpon installation, a DigitalHome user account shall be established.\nThe DigitalHome web system shall provide for authentication and information encryption through a recognized reliable and effective security technology, such as Transport Layer Security.\nThe development of the DigitalHome system shall use methods and techniques such as the following to support system maintenance.\nAlthough the product produced under this document will be a “prototype” version, all modules and components of this prototype version shall be designed and implemented in such a manner that it may be incorporated in a fully specified commercial version of the DigitalHome System.\nAll system documents (Software Requirements Specification, Architectural Design Specification, Module Detailed Design, Module Source Code, and all Test Plans) shall be up-to-date, use the Homeowner document format [HO2305] and reside in the HomeOwner Document Archive at completion of the project.\nHomeOwner has designated object-oriented development, using UML 2.0, as the preferred method for development of software for HomeOwner products.\nExceptions to this rule must be approved by the CIO.\n    Perform the following tasks:\n    1.Verify that each requirement is consistent and free of contradictions.\n    2.Detect any redundant or conflicting entries.\n    3.Create an output file named "verified_requirements.txt" that lists only the approved, non-conflicting requirements.\n    Additionally, supply a summary of any conflicts, contradictions, or redundancies that were resolved.\n    '}]

Requirement: This document specifies the requirements for the development of a “Smart House”, called DigitalHome (DH), by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc.\nA “Smart House” is a home management system that allows home residents to easily manage their daily lives by providing for a lifestyle that brings together security, environmental and energy management (temperature, humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communications.\nThe Smart House components consist of household devices (e.g., a heating and air conditioning unit, a security system, and small appliances and lighting units, etc.), sensors and controllers for the devices, communication links between the components, and a computer system, which will manage the components.\nThe DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is based on the DigitalHome Customer Need Statement.\nIt is made up of a list of the principal features of the system.\nThis initial version of DigitalHome will be a limited prototype version, which will be used by HomeOwner management to make business decisions about the future commercial development of DigitalHomeOwner products and services.\nHence, the SRS is not intended as a comprehensive or complete specification of DigitalHome requirements.\nThese document were prepared by the DigitalHomeOwner Division, in consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwner Inc.\nThe Digital Home system, for the purposes of this document, is a system that will allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home.\nThe user communicates through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web server or on a local home server.\nThe product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition.\nThe Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition is intended as a prototype, which will allow business decisions to be made about future development of a commercial product.\nThe scope of the project will be limited to the

DigitalHome Technician will have rights beyond the DigitalHome General User, capable of setting up and making changes in the configuration of the system (e.g.,setting system parameters and establishing user accounts), and starting and stopping operation of the DigitalHome System.\nThe “prototype” version of the DigitalHome System (as specified in this document) must be completed within twelve months of inception.\nThe development team will consist of five engineers.\nDigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management and communication support.\nThe development team will use the development process specified by the Digital HomeOwner Inc.\nWhere possible, the DigitalHome project will employ widely used, accepted, and available hardware and software technology and standards, both for product elements and for development tools.\nBecause of potential market competition for DigitalHome products, the cost of DigitalHome elements (sensors, controllers, server, tools, etc.), for this project should be minimized.\nThe DigitalHome system will be tested in a simulated environment.\nHowever, the simulated environment will be realistic and adhere to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home and to real sensors and controllers.\nMajor changes to this document (e.g., changes in requirements) must be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.\nAlthough the system to be developed is a “proof of concept” system intended to help Homeowner Inc.\nTo make marketing and development decisions, the following sections describe operational

A concise presentation of the architecture: an architectural presentation that is both concise and, usually, understandable.\n    2. Articulation of the business goals: the business goals presented in the ATAM exercise are being seen by some of the assembled participants for the first time and these are captured in the outputs.\n    3. Prioritized quality attribute requirements expressed as quality attribute scenarios: uses prioritized quality attribute scenarios as the basis for evaluating the architecture.\n    4. A set of risks and non-risks: An architectural risk is a decision that may lead to undesirable consequences in light of stated quality attribute requirements. Similarly, an architectural non-risk is a decision that, upon analysis, is deemed safe.\n    5. A set of risk themes: When the analysis is complete, the evaluation team examines the full set of discovered risks to look for overarching themes that identify systemic weaknesses in the architecture or even in the architecture process and team. If left untreated, these risk themes will threaten the project’s business goals.\n    6. Mapping of architectural decisions to quality requirements: Architectural decisions can be interpreted in terms of the drivers that they support or hinder.\n    7. A set of identified sensitivity points and tradeoff points: Sensitivity points are architectural decisions that have a marked effect on a quality attribute response. Tradeoffs occur when two or more quality attribute responses are sensitive to the same architectural decision, but one of them improves while the other degrades—hence the tradeoff.\n    '}]

setting will be used for the next time period.\nFor each humidistat, up to twenty-four one hour settings per day for every day of the week can be scheduled.\nA DigitalHome system shall use wireless signals to communicate, through the master control unit, with the humidistats.\nThe DigitalHome security system consists of contact sensors and a set security alarms.\nA DigitalHome system shall be able to manage up to fifty door and window contact sensors.\nA DigitalHome system shall be able to activate both light and sound alarms: one sound alarm and one light alarm subsystem, with multiple lights.\nWhen a security breach occurs and a contact sensor is set OPEN, the alarm system shall be activated.\nThe DigitalHome programmable Appliance Manager shall provide for management of a home’s small appliances, including lighting units, by allowing a user to turn them on or off as desired.\nThe Appliance Manager shall be able to manage up to one hundred 115 volt, 10 amp power switches.\nThe system shall be able to provide information about the state of a power switch (OFF or ON), indicating the whether an appliance connected to the power switch is OFF or ON.\nThe system shall be able to change the state of a power switch (OFF to ON, or ON to OFF), in turn changing the state of an appliance connected to the power switch.\nIf a user changes the state of power switch device manually, the device shall remain in that state until the end of the planned or default time period, at which time the planned or default setting will be used for the next time period.\nDigitalHome Planner shall provide a user with the capability to direct the system to set various preset home parameters (temperature, humidity, security contacts, and on/off appliance/light status) for certain time periods.\nFor a given month and year, a user shall be able to create or modify a month plan that specifies for each day, for up to four daily time periods, the environmental parameter settings (temperature, humidity, contact sensors and power switches).\nA user shall be able to override planned parameter values, through the DigitalHome website, or if available, through manual switches on household devices For a given month and year, in the past two years, DigitalHome shall be able to provide a report on the management and control of the home.\nThe month report shall contain daily average, maximum (with time) and minimum (with time) values of temperature and humidity for each thermostat and humidistat, respectively.\nThe month report shall provide the day and time for which any security breaches occurred, that is, when the security alarms were activated.\nThe month report shall provide a section that indicates the periods of time when the DigitalHome System was not in operation.\nDisplays of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, contact sensors and power switches) shall be updated at least every two seconds.\nSensor (temperature, humidity, contact sensor, power state) shall have a minimum data acquisition rate of 10 Hz.\nAn environmental sensor or controller device shall have to be within 1000 feet of the master control device, in order to be in communication with the system.\nThe DigitalHome System must be highly reliable with no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation.\nThe Digital Home System shall incorporate backup and recovery mechanisms.\nThe DigitalHome System will backup all system data (configuration, default parameter settings, planning, and usage data) on a daily basis, with the backup time set by the DigitalHome Technician at system set up.\nIf the DigitalHome System fails (due to power loss, loss of internet access, or other software or hardware failure), the system recovery mechanism shall restore system data (configuration, default parameter settings, planning, and usage data) from the most recent backup.\nAll DigitalHome operations shall incorporate exception handling so that the system responds to a user with a clear, descriptive message when an error or an exceptional condition occurs.\nAlthough there are no specific safety requirements, high system reliability is important to insure there are no system failures in carrying out user requests.\nSuch failures might affect the safety of home dwellers (e.g., security breaches, inadequate lighting in dark spaces, inappropriate temperature and humidity for people who are in ill-health, or powering certain appliances when young children are present).\nUpon installation, a DigitalHome user account shall be established.\nThe DigitalHome web system shall provide for authentication and information encryption through a recognized reliable and effective security technology, such as Transport Layer Security.\nThe development of the DigitalHome system shall use methods and techniques such as the following to support system maintenance.\nAlthough the product produced under this document will be a “prototype” version, all modules and components of this prototype version shall be designed and implemented in such a manner that it may be incorporated in a fully specified commercial version of the DigitalHome System.\nAll system documents (Software Requirements Specification, Architectural Design Specification, Module Detailed Design, Module Source Code, and all Test Plans) shall be up-to-date, use the Homeowner document format [HO2305] and reside in the HomeOwner Document Archive at completion of the project.\nHomeOwner has designated object-oriented development, using UML 2.0, as the preferred method for development of software for HomeOwner products.\nExceptions to this rule must be approved by the CIO.\n\n    Architectural views: To address the requirements and constraints provided, I will generate the architectural views using PlantUML syntax and outline the key architectural decisions made during the design process. Each view will focus on different aspects of the system architecture for the DigitalHome System.\n\n### 1. Logic View\n\nThe logic view illustrates the primary functional modules of the system and their interactions.\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\npackage "DigitalHome System" {\n    [User Interface] --> [User Authentication]\n    [User Interface] --> [Device Management]\n    [User Interface] --> [Home Automation]\n    [User Interface] --> [Security and Surveillance]\n    [User Interface] --> [Energy Management]\n    [User Interface] --> [Notifications and Alerts]\n    [User Interface] --> [Data Privacy and Security]\n\n    [User Authentication] --> [Database Management System]\n    [Device Management] --> [Database Management System]\n    [Home Automation] --> [API Management]\n    [Security and Surveillance] --> [Database Management System]\n    [Energy Management] --> [Data Analytics Platform]\n    [Notifications and Alerts] --> [API Management]\n    [Data Privacy and Security] --> [Encryption Module]\n}\n@enduml\n```\n\n### 2.
